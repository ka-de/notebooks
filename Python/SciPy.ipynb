    "SciPy is a powerful open-source library for scientific and technical computing in Python. It builds upon the capabilities of NumPy and provides additional functionality to tackle a wide range of scientific and engineering problems. Whether you're working on numerical integration, linear algebra, optimization, statistics, or more, SciPy offers a comprehensive toolbox of functions and sub-packages to assist you in your computational tasks.\n",

    "## Numerical Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical integration, also known as numerical integration or numerical quadrature, is a technique in mathematics and computational science used to approximate the definite integral of a function. The definite integral represents the area under a curve between two specified limits (the integral bounds).\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary idea behind numerical integration is to divide the region under the curve into smaller subregions, approximate the area of each subregion, and then sum these approximations to get an estimate of the total area. This is particularly useful when the integral cannot be solved analytically using traditional calculus methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical integration is widely used in various fields, including physics, engineering, computer science, and data analysis, where it's often employed to solve problems involving complex or real-world functions that lack analytical solutions. The choice of integration method depends on the function being integrated and the desired level of accuracy, they are often used in various aspects of game programming, such as physics simulations, collision detection, and animation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various numerical integration methods, each with its own approach to approximating the integral. Some common numerical integration techniques include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rectangular Rule (Midpoint, Left, Right)**: These methods divide the interval into subintervals and approximate the function as a constant within each subinterval. The midpoint rule uses the function's value at the midpoint of each subinterval, while the left and right rules use the function's value at the left or right endpoint of each subinterval."
