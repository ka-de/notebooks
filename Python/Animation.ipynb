    "1. **Initialization**: The code initializes the Pygame library, creates a 400x400 pixel display window (`screen`), and sets up a clock object to control the frame rate.\n",
    "2. **Animation Parameters**:\n",
    "    * `angle`: This variable represents the current angle along a circular path. It starts at 0 radians.\n",
    "    * `angular_speed`: This variable controls the angular speed of the animation in radians per frame. It's set to 0.02 radians per frame, determining how quickly the object moves along the circular path.\n",
    "    * `radius`: The radius of the circular path is set to 100 pixels. This defines how far the object is from the center of the screen.\n",
    "3. **Main Game Loop**:\n",
    "    The program enters an infinite loop (`while True`) that constitutes the main game loop.\n",
    "    Inside this loop, it checks for Pygame events, specifically the `pygame.QUIT` event, which allows the user to close the window and exit the program.\n",
    "4. **Screen Clearing**:\n",
    "    At the beginning of each frame, the screen is filled with a black background using `screen.fill((0, 0, 0))`. This effectively clears the previous frame.\n",
    "5. **Position Calculation**:\n",
    "    The x and y coordinates of the red object are calculated based on the current angle. These calculations use trigonometric functions:\n",
    "    * `x = 200 + radius * math.cos(angle)`: Calculates the x-coordinate based on the angle and radius.\n",
    "    * `y = 200 + radius * math.sin(angle)`: Calculates the y-coordinate based on the angle and radius.\n",
    "    These calculations effectively move the object along a circular path centered at (200, 200) on the screen.\n",
    "6. **Angle Update**:\n",
    "    The `angle` variable is updated by adding `angular_speed` to it. This continuous update of the angle results in the smooth animation of the object moving along the circular path.\n",
    "7. **Drawing the Object**:\n",
    "    The red object (a circle) is drawn on the screen at the calculated `(x, y)` position using `pygame.draw.circle`. It has a radius of 20 pixels.\n",
    "8. **Display Update and Frame Rate Control**:\n",
    "    `pygame.display.flip()` updates the display to show the changes made during the current frame.\n",
    "    `clock.tick(60)` limits the frame rate to 60 frames per second, ensuring that the animation runs at a consistent speed."
