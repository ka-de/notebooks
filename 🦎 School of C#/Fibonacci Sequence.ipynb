    "The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. So, it goes like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on.\n",

    "Humans have long been fascinated with the Fibonacci sequence, and it has been used in many different areas, such as architecture, music, and art. Naturally it has seeped into the computing world as well, and it is a common interview question to ask a candidate to write a function that returns the nth value of the Fibonacci sequence. This is a great question because it tests a candidate's ability to think recursively and to understand the concept of memoization, but it is also inefficient at computing large values of `n`. In this notebook, we will explore a different way of computing `n`, namely: **Matrix Exponentiation**. Let's get the code right out of the way:"
