    "# Levenshtein distance and TheFuzz\n",
    "\n",
    "The Levenshtein distance, also known as the edit distance, is a way to measure how different two strings are by counting the minimum number of operations needed to transform one string into the other. These operations can be insertions, deletions, or substitutions of individual characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have two words, let's say \"kitten\" and \"sitting,\" and you want to find out how different they are using Levenshtein distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it works step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, we set up a grid, where one string is on the top (in this case \"kitten\") and the other is on the side (in this case \"sitting\"). Each cell in the grid represents a comparison between two characters, one from the top string and one from the side string.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We start filling in the grid from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. At each cell, we compare the characters from the two strings. If they are the same, we don't need to do anything, and we simply copy the value from the diagonal cell above it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If the characters are different, we have three options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insertion**: We can insert a character from the side string into the top string. This means we move to the cell above.\n",
    "- **Deletion**: We can delete a character from the top string. This means we move to the cell on the left.\n",
    "- **Substitution**: We can substitute one character with another. This means we move diagonally up and to the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "We keep filling in the grid, considering these three operations, until we reach the bottom-right corner of the grid. The number in that cell represents the Levenshtein distance between the two words. In our example, the Levenshtein distance between \"kitten\" and \"sitting\" is 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\operatorname{lev}(a, b) = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "  |a| & \\text{ if } |b| = 0, \\\\\n",
    "  |b| & \\text{ if } |a| = 0, \\\\\n",
    "  \\operatorname{lev}(\\text{tail}(a),\\text{tail}(b)) & \\text{ if } a[0] = b[0], \\\\\n",
    "  1 + \\min \\begin{cases}\n",
    "          \\operatorname{lev}(\\text{tail}(a), b) \\\\\n",
    "          \\operatorname{lev}(a, \\text{tail}(b)) \\\\\n",
    "          \\operatorname{lev}(\\text{tail}(a), \\text{tail}(b)) \\\\\n",
    "       \\end{cases} & \\text{ otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the formula relates to this process:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `lev(a, b)` represents the Levenshtein distance between strings `a` and `b`.\n",
    "* The formula starts by checking if either of the strings is empty (length is 0). If one of them is empty, the distance is simply the length of the other string.\n",
    "* If the first characters of the strings `a` and `b` are the same, we look at the Levenshtein distance between the remaining parts of the strings, which is calculated recursively.\n",
    "* If the first characters are different, we consider all three operations (insertion, deletion, substitution) and choose the one that minimizes the distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms, it's like solving a puzzle by finding the shortest path through the grid, where each cell represents a choice to either match characters, insert, delete, or substitute, and we're looking for the fewest steps to make the two strings the same."
