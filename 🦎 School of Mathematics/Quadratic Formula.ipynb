    "# Quadratic Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "The Quadratic Formula is a fundamental equation in algebra used to find the roots (solutions) of a quadratic equation of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "ax^2 + bx + c = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Quadratic Formula provides the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation, and it is expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x = \\frac{{-b \\pm \\sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}}}{{2a}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $a$, $b$, and $c$ are coefficients of the quadratic equation.\n",
    "* $x$ represents the solutions (roots) of the equation.\n",
    "* $\\pm$ denotes that there are usually two solutions: one with a plus sign and one with a minus sign.\n",
    "* $\\sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}$ is the square root of the discriminant, which determines the nature of the solutions. If the discriminant is positive, there are two real solutions. If it's zero, there is one real solution (a repeated root). If it's negative, there are two complex solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Quadratic Formula is widely used in mathematics, science, engineering, and various fields to sole quadratic equations, which commonly arise in modeling real-world problems involving parabolic shapes, motion, and optimization."
